A 3D interactive music application that binds together the music the user is hearing with the rendering and geometry of the scene (i.e. thickness of the lines, shape of the mesh).

My friend and I created this within a few days as an experiment to see how the rendering/movement of a 3D scene can link with the music being heard in unique ways. We were inspired by Rez and Audiosurf and wanted to make something similar.
